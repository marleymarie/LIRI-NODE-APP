# LIRI-NODE-APP


LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

This is a node app that allows the user to input one of four commands.
1. Name of Movie <movie-this>
2. Name of Band <Concert-this>
3. Name of Song <Spotify-this-song>
4. <Do-what-it-says>
 
It uses 3API'S to get the userInput information. (Axios: omdb, bands in town api. Spotify's Api)
